=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Throw the most basic of Generic exceptions
    use MyX::Generic;
    if ( ... ) {   # Some code looking for an error
        MyX::Generic->throw(
            error => 'A generic exception'
        );
    }
    
    # In caller catch the Generic exception
    eval { ... };
    if ( my $e = MyX::Generic->caught() ) {
        # Do something to handle the exception like print an error message
        print $e->error(), " via package ", $e->package(), " at ", $e->file,
            " line ", $e->line();
    }
    

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MyX::Generic holds a hierarchy of generic exception classes.  A generic
execption is an exception that is commonly found in many different classes
reguardless of class function.  These exceptions are included in this file to
limit copy and pasting to exception files that are specific for individual
objects.  Use caution in changing the behaviour of already writen exceptions
because they are probably being used my many different classes according to
their current implementation.  Careless implementation changes could have
drastic effects on the functionality of other classes that use these generic
exceptions.

For more information what can be done when throwing and catching an exception
see Exception::Class and Exception::Class::Base.
